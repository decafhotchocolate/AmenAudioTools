# Amen Audio Tools

Based on the [Algorithmic Music Exploration][algo] library, [Amen][amen], this tool uses an AppJar GUI to perform several audio tasks related to smushing beats together.

## Features
 - Reverse order of beats in an audio file.
 - Get every 1st, 2nd, 3rd or 4th beat in an audio file.
 - Get every even or odd beat in an audio file.

### Installation
Install needed dependencies with `requirements.txt`.
~~Windows packaged build coming soon,~~ but running from the straight `gui.py` file should work fine. Not tested on Windows, however.
