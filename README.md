# Amen Audio Tools

Based on the [Algorithmic Music Exploration][algo] library, [Amen][amen], this tool uses an AppJar GUI to perform several audio tasks related to smushing beats together.

## Installation
Install needed dependencies with `requirements.txt`.
Windows packaged build coming soon, but running from the straight `gui.py` file should work fine. Not tested.
